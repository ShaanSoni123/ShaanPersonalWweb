# ðŸ§ª Contact Form Testing Guide

## Quick Troubleshooting Steps:

### 1. Check Web3Forms Dashboard
Go to: https://web3forms.com/dashboard
- Login with your account
- Check if submissions are appearing there
- Verify your email (shaansoni21@gmail.com) is set as recipient

### 2. Verify Email in Web3Forms
**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you've verified your email!
1. Check your inbox (shaansoni21@gmail.com) for verification email from Web3Forms
2. Click the verification link
3. Without verification, emails won't be delivered!

### 3. Check Browser Console
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Submit the form
5. Look for logs showing the submission data and response

### 4. Test the Form Now
1. Fill out: 
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Message: Testing form
2. Click Send
3. Check console for debug logs
4. Check Web3Forms dashboard

### 5. Check Spam Folder
Sometimes the first email goes to spam!
- Check Gmail spam folder
- Mark as "Not Spam" if found there

## Common Issues:

### Issue: "Email not verified"
**Solution**: Check shaansoni21@gmail.com inbox for Web3Forms verification email

### Issue: Form submits but no email
**Solution**: 
- Submissions appear in Web3Forms dashboard but no email = verify your email
- No submissions in dashboard = API key issue

### Issue: Getting error message
**Solution**: Check browser console (F12) for detailed error message
