### 2. **Professional Lighting System**

#### Multi-Light Setup
```
🔆 Ambient Light     → Base illumination (warm cream)
☀️ Directional Light → Main key light with shadows
💙 Monitor Glow      → Blue accent from screens

---

### 5. **Responsive Design**

#### Mobile Optimizations (< 768px)
```javascript
Camera Position: [0, 2.5, 8]  // Further back
Field of View:   60°           // Wider
Camera Sway:     0.1           // Reduced
Auto-Rotate:     Disabled      // Better control
```

#### Desktop Settings
```javascript
Camera Position: [0, 2.5, 6]  // Immersive view
Field of View:   50°           // Focused
Camera Sway:     0.3           // Full effect
Auto-Rotate:     Enabled       // Dynamic
```
